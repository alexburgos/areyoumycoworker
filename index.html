          <p class="fragment fade-in">
            Front-end web development, also known as client-side development
            is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website
            or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly.
          </p>

          <p class="fragment fade-in">
            Tl;Dr: I make websites (including this one I'm using as a presentation!)
            and I try to make them look pretty and useful.
